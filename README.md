* **Developed a Python ETL pipeline** using **requests**, **pandas**, and **psycopg2** to extract job postings from a **REST API**.
* Loaded the structured data into a **PostgreSQL** database.

#### ELT Pipeline

* **Developed a Python and postgreSQL ETL pipeline** to clean messy university data and built an organized Star Schema blueprint to make reporting fast and easy.

* **Secured the database** by giving every item a permanent ID number, so reports never break and analysts can accurately track ranking changes over time.
